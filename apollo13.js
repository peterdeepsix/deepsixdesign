// NAME env variable is to be set to other person

// Okay, ${NAME}, we've had a problem here. 

// ${NAME} we've had a problem. We've had a main B bus undervolt.

// Oxygen tank No. 2 temperature begins steady drop lasting 59 seconds indicating a failed sensor.

// Okay. Right now, ${NAME}, the voltage is â€” is looking good.
// 	And we had a pretty large bang associated with the caution and warning there.
// 	And as I recall, main B was the one that had an amp spike on it once before.

// Oxygen tank No. 2 quantity becomes erratic for 69 seconds before assuming an off-scale low state, indicating a failed sensor. 

// In the interim here, we're starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again.

// That jolt must have rocked the sensor on oxygen quantity 2. It was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent. Now it's full-scale high.

// Master caution and warning triggered by DC main bus B undervoltage. Alarm is turned off in 6 seconds.

// DC main bus B drops below 26.25 volts and continues to fall rapidly.

// Okay, ${NAME}, we're looking at our service module RCS helium 1.
// 	We have -- B is barber poled and D is barber poled, helium 2
// 	D is barber pole, and secondary propellants
// 	I have A and C barber pole.
// 	AC bus fails within 2 seconds. 

// Fuel cell 3 fails.

// Fuel cell current begins to decrease.

// Master caution and warning caused by AC bus 2 being reset.

// Master caution and warning triggered by DC main bus undervoltage.

// DC main bus A drops below 26.25 volts and in the next few seconds levels off at 25.5 volts.

// AC 2 is showing zip.

// Yes, we got a main bus A undervolt now, too, showing.
// 	It's reading about 25 and a half.
// 	Main B is reading zip right now.

// Master caution and warning triggered by high hydrogen flow rate to fuel cell 2.
